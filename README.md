# React E-commerce Project

I'm looking to level up my React skills so decided that an e-commerce site is probably the best way to showcase my familiarity with the framework. My plan here is to build out the functionality and then refactor into smaller components later.

My MVP is to get the bag/checkout and payment set up. As I get spare time, I'll add categories, search, stock levels, sizes, all that lovely stuff. I also want to add a portal that the plumber can serve invoices from and the customer can pay their bill. 

I previously built a React social media site with Django Rest Framework for the API and Elephant SQL. I've also built a couple of Django e-commerce sites with Postgres DBs. This project will be using GraphQL via Hasura for the DB which is integrated with 0Auth for, you guessed it, the authorisation.
