# React E-commerce Project

I'm looking to level up my React skills so decided that an e-commerce site is probably the best way to showcase my familiarity with the framework. My plan here is to build out the functionality and then refactor into smaller components later. I previously built a React social media site with Django Rest Framework for the API and Elephant SQL. I've also built a couple of Django e-commerce sites with Postgres DBs. This project will be using GraphQL via Hasura for the DB which is integrated with 0Auth for, you guessed it, the authorisation.
